Jörmungandr

Jörmungandr (a.k.a. Jormungandr) is a project for scheduling a queue of tasks
onto a limited set of devices.

Use "jormungandr launch /tmp/Server" to launch a server using the directory
"/tmp/Server". The "--numslots" and "-s" options can be used to specify how many
commands the server can run at once.

Once a server is launched, use "jormungandr schedule /tmp/Foo -- cmd arg1 arg2"
to have the "/tmp/Foo" server schedule the command "cmd" for execution, with the
given arguments. Scheduled commands are stored in a queue, so the scheduled
commands are executed on a first-come-first-served basis; however, if the priority
flag ("--priority" or "-p") is present when scheduling a command, that command
will be placed at the front of the queue instead of the back.
