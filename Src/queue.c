//old is the item that will come off next. New is the index after the item that
//was most recently put on. Valid indicies are old, index(old+1), .. index(new-1)

//if new==old, the queue is empty

//if index(new+1) == old, then the array is full.

//NOTE that we're using the unsigned type "size_t" for indicies. As a
//consequence, we're not going to store anything at index zero, and have
//index(0) be the last index in the array.

//NOTE: two indicies of the array are wasted. Index zero and the cell at new.
//So the queue can store arr_len - 2 values without needing to be enlarged.
