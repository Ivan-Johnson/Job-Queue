Licenses can be found in files within the "Licenses" directory.  Most text files
in this repository contain a conspicuous notice that state who owns the
copyright on that file, as well as the year(s) the file was made in. These
notices also specify which of the provided licenses the file can be used
with. All files that do not contain such a notice should have the same
information listed in the "LEGAL" file instead.

The phrases "GPL 2.0" and "GPL 2.0 only" are used to indicate that a file is
licensed ONLY under version two of the "GNU General Public License". In
particular, later versions of the GPL have no bearing on how these files are
allowed to be used.

The lack of an explicit declaration of license or copyright for any file is a
mistake and should be reported as a bug so that it can be fixed. In the unlikely
event that such a mistake does exist, one cannot assume anything about which
license(s) those files can be used with; they might not even be under an open
source license at all.
